# PORTFOLIO PROJECTS

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis of USA Accidents 2016 - 2019

### Requirements

* Data source for the project -  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/diyashmi/us-accidents-dec2021]
* Coded in - Google Colab
* Libraries used - opendatasets, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, folium

### Findings

* Data varies from day to day i.e., On saturday and sunday we can see that the accidents happen on similar timeframe.Though Saturday has higher number of accidents maybe due to some office goers.
* From monday to friday the accidents form two gaussion curvs shwowing two timeframes for accidents.
* On weekdays 6 am to 9 am is generally when office goers travel and from 2 pm to 6 pm is generally the returning time so increase in traffic and accidents
* Only 4.26 % of the cities have accidents higher than 1000
* So many cities seems to have accidents lower than 1 or 0, so it indicates that there is some data missing
* The data colletion must have started in 2016 as there are so gaps in accidents data in that perticular year
